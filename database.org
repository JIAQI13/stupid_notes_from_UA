* structure of Relationnal Databases
** tables
   a relational database consists of a collection of tables
** tuple
   a tuple is simply a sequence (or list) of values
** relation
   refer to the table
** attributes
   a column of a table
** relation instance
   a specific instance of a relation
** atomic
   for all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r be atomic
   a domain if atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units
** null vale
   the value is unknown or does not exist
** database schema
   the logical design of the database
** database instance
   a snapshot of the data in the database at a given instant in time
** realtion schema
   programming language notion of type definition
** superkey
   is a set of one or more attributes that taken collectively, allow us to identify uniquely a tuple in the relation
** candidate keys
   superkeys for which no proper subset is a superkey(minimal superkey)
** primary key
   denote a candidate key that is chosen by the database designer as the principal means of identifying tuples within a relation
** primary key constraints
   the designation of a key represents a constraint in the real-world enterprise being modeled.
** foreign-key constraints 
   from attributes A of relation r1 to the primary-key B of relation r2 states that on any database instance ,the value of A for each tuple in r1 must also be the value of B for some tuple in r2
   Attribute set A is called a foreign key from r1, referencing r2
   the relation r1 is also called the referencing relation fo the foreign-eky constraint, and r2 is called the regerence relation
** referential integrity constraint
   the values appearing in specified attributes of any tuple in the referencing relation also appear in specified attributes of at least one tuple in the referenced relation
** schema diagrams
   primary-key attributes are shown underlined
   foreign-key constraints appaer as arrows from the foreign-key attributs of the referencing realtion to the primary key of the referenced relation.
   two-headed arrow instead of single headed arrow to indicate a referential integrity constraint that is not a foreign-key constraints
** 2.5 Relational Query Languages
   A query language is a language in which a user requests information from the database
** imperative query language
   the user instructs the system to perform a specific sequence of operations on the database to compute the desired result
** functional query language
   the computation is expressed as the evaluation of functions that may operate on data in the database or on the results of other functions
** declararive quary language
   the user describes the desired information without giving a specific steps or function calls for obtaining that information

***the raltional algebra forms the theoretical basis of the SQL query language***

** 2.6 Relational Algebra
   consist of set of operations that take one or two realtions as input and produce a new realtion as their result
** select
   selects tuples that satisfy a given predicate    sigma(dept_name)="physics"(instructor)
   to select those tuples of the instructor relation where the instructor is in the Physics department
** project
   is unary operation that returns its argument relation
