** 6/4
*** *****find the interval**********
*** finding the interval below the note is the same as the minor in major we need to make the interval bigger
*** go up look into major and go down look into minor if it is in the scale then directly write down the major or minor
*** 1. count te line and make sure the right note
*** 2. then change it to the right sharp or flat using the whole / half step 
*** or use the 4th and 5th circle to find out the right major and then find out if it is a flat or sharp
*** find the interval in the nots
*** 1.symbol all the sharp and flat to find out the hidden sharp and flat
*** 2. the do the same thing to find the iterval
