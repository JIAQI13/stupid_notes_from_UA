* 5/28 Polar coordinate 
 
 $ is theta

** (R,theta) =( cos theta, sin theta)  

** R= 2asin$--> R^2= 2a R sin$

** the graph of a polar curve R=f($) is the net of all pints (R,$) that satsify the equation 

** sketch the graph of $=pi/4 , is a line 

** R = 1- cos$ the graph is a curve  

** R = sin3$ rose shape  

** R = a cosn$, R = a sinn$ are petal curves (roses)

** if n is odd --> the curve has n petals

** if n = even --> the curve has 2n petals

** Tangents to polar curves

** C: f($) <==> x=Rcos$ y=Rsin$

** m = dy/dx = (dy/d$)/(dx/d$) = (dR/d$) sin$ + Rcos$ / ((dR/d$) cos$) -(Rsin$)

** let R = 1-cos$, find the slope of the tangent to the cordioid when $=pi/4 用sin和cos的坐标值求导得到一个关于theta的方程带入即可得到

** let c : R=f($) a polar curve has a horizontal tangetn if dy/d$ =0 but dx/d$ !=0, a vertical tangent if dx/d$=0 but dy/d$ !=0

*** find the points on the cardioid at which there is i)a horizontal tangent ii)a vertical tangent


* 5/29 vector function sand space curves 
** a vector funcrion is a functiion with domain R and range the net of all vecors V
*** ex find the domain of ->R,->R = ln(t-2)i + e^t j + sqr(t-1) k

*** f(t)=ln(t-2)
** a vector function R(t) is const at a a belongs to D 和正常方程一样的limit原则 
** R(t)<f(t),g(t),h(t)> is const at a  <=> the real function f g h are const at a 
** the net C of all points (x,y,z) in space with x=f(t) y=g(t) z=h(t) t belongs interval is called a space curve (*) = parametic egs of the curve,C
*** Describe the curve define by the vector function <1-t,3t,2t>
*** which is a parametric egs of a line through x0 y0 z0 direction v=<a,b,c>
*** heliv:-->sketch the curve given by R(t) if R(t) =<2sint,-2cost,3t> 
    x^2+y^2=4 the curve likes on this cylinder
    create the table between x and y
*** parametrize the intersection of the 2 surfaces: y^2-z^2=x-2 and y^2+z^2=9 with
*** a)y=t as parameter 由a得出t的范围，然后用t表示x，最后把xyz用已知的t表示
*** b)y=3sint z=3cost <==> y^2+z^2=9, x=9sin^2t-9cos^2t +2,这样就化成了sin和cos的表示形式t belongs to R 
    solution y=t --> y^2+z^2=9 ==> t^2+z^2=9 ==> z^2=9-t^2 ==> t [-3,3]

* Derivatives and Inteqval of vector functions 
** R(t)=lim n->0 (R(


** 和正常方程一样求导

** R'(t) exists and R'(t)!=0 then R(t)= the tangent vector to c

** the tangent line to curve c at point p in the line passing through p with direction vector R(t)M


** the vector T(t)=R(t)/|R'(t)| --> unit tangent vector

*** ex find an equation of the tangent line to the curve defined by the parametric egs: 

*** x=t, y=t^2 z=t^3 at the point (1,1,1)

*** solution R(t)=<t,t^2,t^3>  R'(t)=<1,2t,3t^2>

*** (1,1,1)要确保和要求的点一样的坐标

** let u v = diff vector functions 
   
*** the sum deritive is the deritive sum

*** cu(t)=cu'(t)m

*** f(t)u(t)product rule 标量，点乘，叉乘



** let R(t)=<f(t),g(t),h(t)> 

*** 对每个坐标的函数积分就可以了

** a curve define by R(t) is called smooth if R in continuous and R(t)!=0

*** show that it is smooth R=<t^3+T,4t^3,3t^2>

**** since they are all continuous functions, R(t) is continuousand 3t^2+1!=0 for all t ==> R'(t) is none zero and the curve is smooth



** Acclength and cwzcature  


*** let c be a soace awxe given by the egs:
    x=f(t) y=g(t) z=h(t) a<=t<=6
    and f' g' h' are constant if c is traversed exactly once as t in areares from a to b then the length of c from a to b is 
    L=|b |R(t)|dt==>
      |a
      blablabal


*** 求导就是对xyz三项分别求导

*** parametrize the helix 
    R(t)=<acost,asint,bt> a,b>0 in terms of arc length measure from the point (a,0,0) in the direction of increasing t
    solution: (a,0,0) converge to t =0
    bt=0,b>0 ==> t=0
    ****s = s(t) = |t|R'(u)|du *****  (arclength functions)
                   |0
   带入求解 s和t的关系，把原柿子里的t用s代替
** curvature
*** K=kappa
*** the curvature of a smooth curve c is defined as k=|dT->/dS| where T = unit tangent vector

*** note k =|(dT/dt)/(dS/dt)|=|T'(t)/R'(t)|
*** the courxature of a cureve c given by R(t) is 
    K(t)=|R'(t)x R''(t)|/|R(t)|^3

*** find the curvature at an arbitery point when R(t) =<acost,asint,bt> ab>0
    
**** find K(t) 根据公式得到一阶导数和二阶导数，再算叉乘一阶导和二阶导,再计算结果的模长，再算R的模长，除一下
